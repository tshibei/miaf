## 📊 Results
 
MIAF was evaluated on a fully held-out test cohort (2024) after all training and feature selection were completed on a separate cohort (2022). Key results on the **held-out test set**:
 
### Classification Performance
 
| Metric | Before MIAF | After MIAF |
|---|---|---|
| Precision (PPV) | 86% | **98%** (p < 0.001) |
| Specificity | 0% | **92%** [89–95%] |
| Sensitivity (naHFOs) | 100% | 73% [71–75%] |
| Sensitivity (trueHFOs) | 100% | **86%** [84–88%] |
| AUROC | — | **0.92** [0.90–0.93] |
| AUPRC | — | **0.99** [0.98–0.99] |
 
*Confidence intervals computed with Clopper-Pearson (specificity/sensitivity) and bootstrapping (AUROC/AUPRC).*
 
### Artifact Removal
 
- Removed **92.4%** of artifacts while retaining **73.1%** of non-artifactual HFOs
- Reduced artifact contamination from **13.7% → 1.6%** of all detections (12.1% drop)
- After filtering, **98.4%** of remaining HFOs were non-artifactual
 
### Clinical Validation
 
Applied to **49+ million HFO detections** from the full hospitalization of all 35 patients:
 
- Improved HFO correlation with seizure onset zone (SOZ) in **76.5% of patients** (26/34)
- Improved HFO correlation with resected volume in **88.9% of patients** (16/18)
- Enables HFO analysis across **all states of vigilance** (not restricted to NREM sleep)
 
### Model Selection
 
Compared logistic regression, SVM, support vector regression, and a 3-layer neural network across 6 signal source configurations. Binary logistic regression on intracranial data (HFO channel + intracranial CAR) was selected as the final model — statistically comparable to top alternatives, with superior interpretability and no dependence on scalp EEG.
 
### Benchmarking
 
MIAF outperformed two alternative artifact detectors (qHFO detector alone; qHFO + muscle artifact + background activity filters) on both ROC and precision-recall curves.

# A. Overview of the Pipeline

The MIAF pipeline consists of **three modular stages**:

1. **EEG Preprocessing**  
   Remove bad channels, apply common average reference (CAR), and bandpass filter signals.

2. **HFO Detection (User-Defined)**  
   You supply your own algorithm that outputs candidate HFO events.

3. **HFO Classification**  
   A logistic regression classifier assigns each event to:  
   - artifact  
   - non-artifactual HFO (naHFO)  
   - invalid

# D. Running the Pipeline

## D1. Run the Full Pipeline in MATLAB

In MATLAB, run all steps (preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification) from `matlab/`:

```matlab
demo_full_pipeline
```

This script:

- Loads example inputs  
- Runs preprocessing  
- Extracts event features  
- Performs HFO classification  
- Writes outputs to the `outputs/` folder  

Generated files include:

- `preprocessed_eeg.mat`  
- `preprocessed_channel_info.mat`  
- `classified_hfo_events.csv`  
- `hfo_event_features.mat`

---

## D2. Run Only the HFO Classification Step in Python

If preprocessing and detection have already been completed, you may run only Step 3 using Python.

Run from `python/`:

```python
python demo_classify_events.py
```

This script:

- Loads detected HFO events  
- Reads preprocessed EEG (MATLAB v7.3 via `h5py`)  
- Extracts features  
- Applies logistic regression using `model.json`  
- Produces the same outputs as the MATLAB version  

MATLAB and Python produce **identical classification results**.

    'preprocessed_channel_info_file', 'preprocessed_channel_info.mat');
```

## Generated Outputs

The following outputs are generated in the `outputs/` folder.

### Preprocessed EEG 
`preprocessed_eeg.mat`

 Variable | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ecog_hfo_raw` | CAR-referenced ECoG signals (raw, unfiltered) |

# G. Example Datasets for Visualization

Located in:

```
data_for_visualization/
```

Each example contains:

1. `example_raw_eeg_{n}.set`: EEG signals  
2. `example_detected_hfo_events_{n}.set`: Detected HFO events with ground-truth labels (brain / artifact) 
3. `example_classified_hfo_events_{n}.set`: MIAF-classified HFO events with classification labels (artifact / non-artifactual HFO (naHFO) / invalid)

These are EEGLAB `.set` datasets for visualization only.

# H. Visualizing EEG + HFO Events in EEGLAB

## H1. Install EEGLAB
Download from:  
https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php

## H2. Load the Example Datasets
1. In EEGLAB: **File → Load existing dataset(s)**  
2. Open the `.set` files in `data_for_visualization/`

## H3. View EEG & Event Markers
Open the scroll viewer:  
**Plot → Channel data (scroll)**

Use the arrows to scroll through the EEG.

## H4. Example EEG Epochs and Classifier Behavior
Three representative EEG epochs are shown to illustrate how the classifier behaves under different signal conditions:

### Example 1 — Clear Artifact

This epoch contains one labeled artifact that is visually obvious.
The classifier successfully identified the labeled artifact as well as additional unlabeled artifacts present in the segment. This demonstrates the model’s ability to generalize to artifact morphology even beyond the manually labeled examples.

### Example 2 — Brain-Generated HFO

This epoch includes one labeled HFO arising from neural activity.
The classifier correctly identified the labeled HFO; however, several additional brain-generated HFOs occurring within a brief window were misclassified as artifacts. These HFOs are subtle and not superimposed on clear spikes, making them difficult to distinguish from artifacts, especially given that the detector was tuned conservatively to prioritize artifact removal.

### Example 3 — Mixed Muscle Artifacts and HFOs

This epoch contains a mixture of muscle artifacts and brain-generated HFOs.
A scalp EEG trace is also displayed for reference. Prominent HFOs appear on sharp waves, but significant muscle activity is present as well, making it difficult to differentiate the two using a single channel alone. The classifier successfully distinguished the muscle artifacts from the brain-generated HFOs.
